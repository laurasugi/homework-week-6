    <h1><b>{README} week 6</b></h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>For this week's process I began with the index page
        and worked my way out from there.  After completing
        the index, I worked my way down the list of
        links on the main page to create their own
        separate pages.</li>
    <br />
    <br />
        <li>I didn't have any major technical issues
        this week. I have however been struggling
        with how much code to use, mostly in respect
        to attributes.  I've been having a hard time
        determining how precise and detailed I need
        to be while still keeping my code to a reasonable
        length.  Especially after the last few weeks
        lessons where I learned a huge amount
        of new attributes and elements. This is something
        I plan to look into more along with going to the
        issues page to ask for help.</li>
    <br />
    <br />
        <li>Overall I have been feeling fairly overwhelmed
        by this course, and the amount of information
        we are learning and I feel that as a result of
        this, this homework assignment is not my best work.
        However the challenge is still fun and I am hoping
        to keep improving and start taking more advantage of
        the resources provided (especially the issues page). </li>
